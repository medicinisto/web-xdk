/**
 * This class manages a state variable for whether we are online/offline, triggers events
 * when the state changes, and determines when to perform tests to validate our online status.
 *
 * It performs the following tasks:
 *
 * 1. Any time we go more than this.pingFrequency (100 seconds) without any data from the server, flag us as being offline.
 *    Rationale: The websocket manager is calling `getCounter` every 30 seconds; so it would have had to fail to get any response
 *    3 times before we give up.
 * 2. While we are offline, ping the server until we determine we are in fact able to connect to the server
 * 3. Any time there is a browser `online` or `offline` event, check to see if we can in fact reach the server.  Do not trust either event to be wholly accurate.
 *    We may be online, but still unable to reach any services.  And Chrome tabs in our tests have shown `navigator.onLine` to sometimes be `false` even while connected.
 * 4. Trigger events `connected` and `disconnected` to let the rest of the system know when we are/are not connected.
 *    NOTE: The Websocket manager will use that to reconnect its websocket, and resume its `getCounter` call every 30 seconds.
 *
 * NOTE: Apps that want to be notified of changes to online/offline state should see Layer.Core.Client's `online` event.
 *
 * NOTE: One iteration of this class treated navigator.onLine = false as fact.  If onLine is false, then we don't need to test
 * anything.  If its true, then this class verifies it can reach layer's servers.  However, https://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=277372 has replicated multiple times in chrome; this bug causes one tab of chrome to have navigator.onLine=false while all other tabs
 * correctly report navigator.onLine=true.  As a result, we can't rely on this value and this class must continue to poll the server while
 * offline and to ignore values from navigator.onLine.  Future Work: Allow non-chrome browsers to use navigator.onLine.
 *
 * ## Execution Paths
 *
 * Path A: Initialization Path
 *
 * 1. `start()` method calls `checkOnlineStatus()`
 * 2. `checkOnlineStatus()` does a Ping operation to the server
 * 3. `_connectionListener()` detects the result of the Ping in the form of an XHR success or failure to reach the server
 *   a. Success: Schedule `_onlineExpiring()` to be called in 100 seconds (rescheduled if any network traffic is received)
 *   b. Failure: Call `_onlineExpiring()` which does one verification Ping to the server to make sure it is unreachable (rather than CORS or other error)
 *     i. Ping fails: Calls `_onlineExpired()` which Changes to state to offline mode, and calls `_scheduleNextOnlineCheck()`
 *     ii. Ping succeedes: Handled by `_connectionListener()`; Go to #3 and #3a
 *
 *
 * NOTES: Any failure of `checkOnlineStatus` could be caused by CORS errors or server request timing out
 *    (should actually get a gateway timeout before that happens... which itself gets CORS header errors) rather than connection errors,
 *    therefore we must verify loss of connection via Ping
 *
 * PATH B: Client is Online Path:
 *
 * 1. Call to `_onlineExpiring()` is scheduled to be called in 100 seconds
 * 2. Websocket packets sent by the server and XHR responses from servers are intercepted by `_connectionListener()` which  reschedules `_onlineExpiring()` each time
 * 3. Websocket pings make it unlikely that `_onlineExpiring()` ever gets reached... but if the websocket connection is down then `_onlineExpiring()` is called, does one verification Ping to the server to make sure it is unreachable
 *   a. Ping fails: Calls `_onlineExpired()` which Changes to state to offline mode, and calls `_scheduleNextOnlineCheck()`
 *   b. Ping succeedes: ping response observed by `_connectionListener()`; Go to #2
 *
 * PATH C: Client goes offline
 *
 * 1. Ping fails: Calls `_onlineExpired()` which changes the state to offline mode, and calls `_scheduleNextOnlineCheck()`
 * 2. `_scheduleNextOnlineCheck()` schedules (using exponential backoff) calls to `checkOnlineStatus()`
 * 3. `checkOnlineStatus()` Pings the server
 *    a. `_connectionListener()` detects the result of the Ping in the form of an XHR success or failure to reach the server
 *      i. Success: Changes state to Online and schedules `_onlineExpiring()`
 *      ii. Failure: Go to #2 and increase the exponential backoff, repeat indefinitely until we have success
